# Custom Flight Booking Application

- Custom flight booking application built by Torrence A. Brown. Key knowledge demonstrated includes effective use of Semantic HTML, BEM methodology, CSS Flexbox, Ephemeral State Management via React Hooks, interaction with SkyScanner Api utilizing both *Axios* and *Fetch* libraries. Also, introducing my feable attempt at learning animations via CSS! I.e Upon hovering over the "Send it" button take notice of the beautiful transition, how the button evolves from "basic and non-existent" to "illuminous and "Hey, I got all dressed up for you, why don't you notice me?"" More detailed and organized README to come....
