- Custom flight booking application built by myself, key knowledge demonstrated includes effective use of Semantic HTML, BEM methodology, CSS Flexbox, Ephemeral State Management via React Hooks, interaction with SkyScanner Api utilizing both *Axios* and *Fetch* libraries. Also, introducing my feable attempt at learning animations via CSS!

More detailed and organized README to come....
